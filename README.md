## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

CentoAI is built on a modular architecture, with the following key components:

### 1. **Smart Contracts**
   - **LiquidityManager.sol**: Manages liquidity across **Aave**, **Compound**, and **Uniswap V3**.
   - **Arbitrage.sol**: Executes flash loan arbitrage strategies using **Balancer V2**.
   - **Vault.sol**: Manages user balances and strategy execution.
   - **VaultFactory.sol**: Deploys personalized vaults for users.

### 2. **Frontend**
   - Built with **Next.js** and **OnchainKit** for seamless wallet integration and portfolio visualization.
   - Provides a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring portfolio performance and strategy execution.
   - Integrates **Privy** for embedded wallets and social logins, enabling users to onboard with email or existing wallets.

### 3. **Backend**
   - **Node.js** backend for handling off-chain computations and API integrations.
   - Fetches real-time APY data from DeFi protocols and provides it to the AI agent.

### 4. **AI Agent**
   - Analyzes yield opportunities and arbitrage strategies using machine learning models.
   - Executes strategies securely using **Coinbase AgentKit**.

## üîß Workflows

### 1. **User Onboarding**
   - Users connect their wallets or sign in with email/social login using **Privy**.
   - A personalized vault is deployed for the user using **VaultFactory.sol**.
   - Users deposit ERC20 tokens (e.g., USDC, ETH) into their vault.

### 2. **AI-Driven Strategy Execution**
   - The AI agent fetches real-time APY data from **Aave**, **Compound**, and **Uniswap V3**.
   - It analyzes yield opportunities and identifies arbitrage opportunities using **Balancer V2** flash loans.
   - The AI agent executes strategies such as:
     - **Yield Farming**: Moves funds between protocols to maximize APY.
     - **Flash Loan Arbitrage**: Executes risk-free arbitrage between DEXes.

### 3. **Portfolio Management**
   - Users can monitor their portfolio performance, strategy execution, and transaction history through the dashboard.
   - The dashboard provides insights into:
     - Current APY across protocols.
     - Profit/loss from arbitrage strategies.
     - Historical performance of the portfolio.
